# Hands To OLED
Hands to OLED is a project that leverages the power of Mediapipe, an open-source framework for building multimodal (audio, video, and sensor) applied ML pipelines, to track the position of a pointer finger in real-time. By utilizing the Mediapipe hand tracking solution, the project extracts the x and y coordinates of the finger and communicates this data to an OLED display via a serial monitor encoding scheme. This allows users to visualize and interact with the tracked finger position in a tangible and intuitive manner.
